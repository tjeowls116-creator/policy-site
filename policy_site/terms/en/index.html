<h1>Terms (en)</h1><p><em>Source: src/values-en/strings_legal.xml</em></p><pre>Terms of Service (Full)

1. Acceptance. By installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms and the policies referenced here. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

2. Service. The App provides market‑indicator calculations, screeners, and alert notifications for digital assets. It is not a broker, exchange, wallet, or advisor and does not execute orders.

3. Eligibility &amp; Accounts. You must be legally permitted to use the App. Some features require sign‑in or an in‑app purchase. You are responsible for your device, network, and safeguarding credentials.

4. Subscriptions &amp; Billing. Paid features (e.g., PRO) are offered as auto‑renewing subscriptions via your app store account. Prices may change; taxes may apply. Refunds are handled under the store’s policy. Manage/cancel in your store account.

5. Acceptable Use. No reverse engineering, scraping, abusive automation, market manipulation, rights violations, or unlawful use.

6. Third‑Party Dependencies. The App depends on third‑party exchanges, data providers, networks, and OS services; data can be delayed, incomplete, or unavailable.

7. Alerts. Alerts are best‑effort and may be delayed, duplicated, or missed. Validate signals before acting.

8. Risk. Trading digital assets involves significant risk, including loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results. You are responsible for compliance and taxes.

9. No Advice. Information is general and not personalized investment, financial, or trading advice.

10. IP Rights. The App and content are protected by IP laws. Licenses are limited, revocable, and non‑transferable.

11. Warranty Disclaimer. Service is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind.

12. Liability Limit. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect or consequential damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill; overall liability is capped at fees paid for the Service during the 12 months before the claim.

13. Indemnity. You will defend and indemnify us against claims arising from your use, breach, or rights infringement.

14. Suspension/Termination. We may suspend/terminate access for violations or risks. Uninstalling does not cancel subscriptions.

15. Governing Law &amp; Disputes. These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Korea, with courts in Seoul having exclusive jurisdiction, except where consumer law requires otherwise.

16. Changes. We may update these Terms; material changes will be announced in‑app or via store notes; continued use means acceptance.

17. Contact. See the support address in the app‑store listing.</pre>
