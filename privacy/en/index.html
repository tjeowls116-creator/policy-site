<h1>Privacy (en)</h1><pre>Privacy Policy (Full; GDPR + CCPA/CPRA)

1. Scope. This Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

2. Data We Collect. (a) Purchase Data: store purchase identifiers, receipts, subscription status. (b) Usage &amp; Diagnostics: app events, performance, crash logs. (c) Device Data: language/locale, OS version, model, anonymized identifiers. (d) Feedback: messages or emails you send us. We do not collect private exchange API keys or execute trades.

3. Purposes. Provide, maintain, and improve the Service; deliver alerts; personalize features; process payments; detect abuse; comply with law.

4. Sharing. We share with processors/service providers (analytics, crash reporting, payments/app‑store), affiliates, and where required by law or to protect rights. We do not sell or share personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising as defined by the CCPA/CPRA.

5. Security. We use reasonable technical and organizational measures; no system is 100% secure.

6. Retention. We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes described or as required by law.

7. International Transfers. Where data is transferred across borders, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) as required.

8. Your Rights (GDPR/UK). If you are in the EEA/UK, you may request access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and object to processing; you may withdraw consent at any time (where processing is based on consent). You can lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority.

9. Legal Bases (GDPR/UK). Contract (to provide the Service); legitimate interests (analytics, security, service improvement); consent (where required); and legal obligations.

10. California Residents (CCPA/CPRA). You have the right to know, delete, and correct personal information; to opt‑out of sale or sharing; to limit the use of sensitive personal information; and to be free from discrimination for exercising your rights. We do not sell or share personal information and do not process sensitive personal information for purposes requiring a “Limit the Use” link. If our practices change, we will provide an in‑app mechanism labeled “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.” We will verify requests and respond within statutory timeframes.

11. Children. The Service is not directed to children under the age required by local law (e.g., 16 under GDPR—may be lowered to 13 by a Member State; under CCPA, additional protections apply for users under 16). We do not knowingly collect their data.

12. Changes. We may update this Policy; material changes will be notified in‑app or via store notes.

13. Contact. For privacy inquiries or rights requests, use the support contact in the app‑store listing.</pre>
